            h3 Hi!
            p.
              I am a doctoral candidate in Social Studies Education in the Department of Curriculum &amp; Instruction at the University of Texas at Austin.  My areas of interest are exploring the relationship between teacher and cultural identity among Asian American and Latin@ pre- and in-service teachers; citizenship; immigration; adding counternarratives to the curriculum; and teaching against Islamophobia.  In addition to my work in social studies I am pursuing a graduate portfolio in Asian American Studies.


            p.
              Currently I am an assistant instructor of social studies methods for our bilingual education and ESL-certification undergraduates and have developed Asian American studies and Mexican American/Tejano studies curriculum for use in local school districts.  I am a veteran elementary teacher with a M. Ed. in Bilingual Education and have presented at CUFA (2014, 2015, 2016), NCSS (2015, 2016), AERA (2014, 2015, 2016), NABE (2013, 2015), TABE (2010, 2012), and other Central Texas conferences.  I taught first, second, fourth, and fifth grades in Austin ISD for nine years.

              Outside of academia, my interests include baking, art, music, documentaries, crafting, and planning elaborate themed parties for my two young daughters.
